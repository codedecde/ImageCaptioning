# ImageQA
Deep Learning Course, 2016

The aim of the project is to answer questions posed in natural language in the context of an image. We use LSTM nodes to encode the question along with ConvNets to encode the image, and apply a word-by-word attention mechanism to predict the single-word answer.

Datasets : VQA, COCO-QA
